My blog based on Jekyll-Bootstrap.

## About Jekyll-Bootstrap

For all usage and documentation please see: <http://jekyllbootstrap.com>

## About theme

This theme is the copy of [Simpleyyt](http://simpleyyt.github.io) portal page.

## Usage

You can edit the `_config.yml` file to change the setting of site. If you want to change avatar or favicon, just replace the files in `assets\themes\Snail\img`.

## About excerpt

There are 2 ways of excerpt: "teaser" and "truncate_words" (Configurated in _config.yml).

 * "teaser": look for the More tag (<!--more-->) and create a teaser from the content that precedes the More tag.
You must place "<!--more-->" at paragraph in post. The whole content will be displayed in homepage if no More tag found in post.

 * "truncate_words": generate an excerpt automatically by selecting the first 20 words of the post. It doesn't work well in some of no-English post.
